# Title: TarMAC: Targeted Multi-Agent Communication

# Author: Das et al (2019)

#### General Content: Introduce network architecture that accounts for targeted message communication based on a soft attention mechanism. Messages are real-valued vectors which are aggregated with the help of attention weights. Furthermore, the approach allows for multiple rounds of communication before an action is executed.

#### Keypoints:

### Questions:
* How can we analyze the communication vectors? Form of embedding - how to visualize multi-round "discussions"?
* What does without attention mean - simple DIAL? alphas=1
* Is it possible to learn the number of stages/interactions instead of pre-specifying?
* How to specify dims of communication? - How sparse/high-dim do they have to be?
* How to come up with the query vector? Separate supervised learning problem?
