# Title: The Free Energy Principle for Perception - An Introduction

# Author: Ostwald (2015)

#### General Content: 

General methodological introduction to the variational Bayes framework for the Free Energy Principle

1. Intro FEP
2. Math
3. Parametric Bayesian Inference, Information Theory, Variational Bayes
4. Free-form mean-field variational Bayes for univariate Gaussian models
5. Fixed-form mean-field variational Bayes for static nonlinear models
6. Fixed-form mean-field variational Bayes for dynamic nonlinear models

#### Keypoints: 
* Chapter 1:
	* FEP: Neurobiological Interpretation of application of deterministic approx. Bayesian inference methods to nonlinear hierarchical random dynamical systems.
	* Biological agents minimize dispersion/entropy of their interoceptive and exteroceptive states. Minimizing state dispersion in long run results in mim of surprise in every point in time.
	* Min of variational energy under hierarchical models encoded by adjustment of agent's internal states is known as Bayesian filtering and leads to neurobiological predictive coding schemes.

* Chapter 2:
	* Review Gaussian Trafo theorems and proofs (Bishop Ch. 2)
	

#### Questions: 

* Heterogenous agents - how can we model risk-aversion e.g.? In Macro models this is specified by concavity of the utility functions and the derived optimal actions. Or by the future discount factor.
