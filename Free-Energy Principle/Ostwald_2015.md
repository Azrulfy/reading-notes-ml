# Title: The Free Energy Principle for Perception - An Introduction

# Author: Ostwald (2015)

#### General Content: 

General methodological introduction to the variational Bayes framework for the Free Energy Principle

1. Intro FEP
2. Math
3. Parametric Bayesian Inference, Information Theory, Variational Bayes
4. Free-form mean-field variational Bayes for univariate Gaussian models
5. Fixed-form mean-field variational Bayes for static nonlinear models
6. Fixed-form mean-field variational Bayes for dynamic nonlinear models

#### Keypoints: 
* Chapter 1:
	* FEP: Neurobiological Interpretation of application of deterministic approx. Bayesian inference methods to nonlinear hierarchical random dynamical systems.
	* Biological agents minimize dispersion/entropy of their interoceptive and exteroceptive states. Minimizing state dispersion in long run results in mim of surprise in every point in time.
	* Min of variational energy under hierarchical models encoded by adjustment of agent's internal states is known as Bayesian filtering and leads to neurobiological predictive coding schemes.

* Chapter 2:
	* Review Gaussian Trafo theorems and proofs (Bishop Ch. 2)
	* Completing the square theorem - allows identification of parameters of Gaussian density based on quadratic form
	* Gamma distribution and different parametrizations - exponential distribution
	* Jacobian: Matrix of all first-order partial derivative of a vector-valued function
	* Linear approx of vector fields - Use Jacobian for the first derivative analog of the Taylor series approximation

* Chapter 3:
	* Bayesian Inference: Identification of Log model evidence and posterior distribution for a Generative Model
	* Bayesian Parameter Estimation: Not only interested in single point estimate but full probability distribution over the possible parameter values. The conditional distribution is inherent in the specification of the generative model and is thus not created once the data is observed!
	

#### Questions: 

* Heterogenous agents - how can we model risk-aversion e.g.? In Macro models this is specified by concavity of the utility functions and the derived optimal actions. Or by the future discount factor.
